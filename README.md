# General Info
This is a classical music generation project where we build 2 different architectures in 3 different ways to predict next note, duration and offset. Dataset consisted of 9 violin pieces (*midi* format) downloaded from musescore which gives more than 1.5 hours of audio data. Models are explained in the notebooks **prep_train_model_0**, **prep_train_model_1** and **prep_train_model_2**. Music can be generated in the [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/twrzeszcz/music-generation-streamlit/main/app_streamlit_merged.py) app. All necessary files for deployment are in this repo including the dependencies in the **requirements.txt**, packages in the **packages.txt**, models, pickled unique values and mapping functions and the main file **app_streamlit_merged.py**. There is also a second module deoployed in the same app from the other repo [GitHub](https://github.com/twrzeszcz/music-genre-classification).
